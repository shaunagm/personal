				                If you enjoyed this activity and found any part of it valuable, I encourage you to take the contribution you just wrote about and submit it to MergeStories.  This is something that newcomers at events can use to get a mental picture of what contributing is actually like, and to see that everyone - experienced people and newcomers alike - struggle with contributing sometimes.
