					        Speaker: We've run 21 events on college campuses since I joined a year and a half ago, including 9 so far this year.  Most events are structured as a day-long workshop.  In the mornings, we teach people how to use tools like git, IRC, and issue trackers.  Around lunch time, we do a career panel.  And in the afternoons, we do a contributions workshop, where we help students contribute to real free and open source projects.  Can anyone guess what the hardest part is?

I'm going to briefly go over some of the ones we've come across, and talk about what we do to address them.  Then, for the majority of this session, we're going to do an activity that will help us discover new issues and address them.  This activity is a process we can use over and over again to improve our projects and the experience of contributing to them.

				            Research: Find website, source code, documentation, issue tracker, mailing list, IRC channel.  (If the project doesn't have them, probably not a good first project!
				            Evaluation: How busy is the project?  How quickly do pull requests get merged?  How often do people give feedback?  How friendly is the IRC channel?  How helpful is the mailing list?
				            Contact:  Say hello in IRC.  Verify a bug in the issue tracker.  Answer a question on the mailing list.

                            Speaker:  Learning how to read and understand an issue is a really important skill, and it's something we teach.  One of the ways we do that is through giving our attendees links to some real issues.  To make it fun, we use some pretty hilarious issues: one is a bug in Android that erased the month of December.  Another is an issue where Open Office couldn't print on Tuesdays.  Our attendees really enjoy this activity, though they find it challenging.

                            Speaker:  But one activity isn't enough to make these newcomers experts at decoding complicated issues.  So we do a bit of work to make sure the bugs people are tackling are ready for them.
                            Collect issues:  We start with bugs labeled easy, bite-size, first task in our own issue trackers and in the trackers of projects affiliated with us.  We used to end here, but this was in no way enough.  In fact, it was actively demoralizing.  Who feels good when they can't do something labeled 'easy'?  These issues need more hands on preparation.
                            Filter:  The next step is to filter the issues you've collected.  Some choices are obvious.  If the bug has already been patched, or marked as 'won'tfix', take it off your list!  Others are more of a judgment call.  Does the question actually seem doable in a few hours?  This is where it's good to cultivate a 'newcomer outlook' - something our activity later will help us with.
                            Label:  We go through and add a lot more information to each issue we find.  A good rule of thumb is that if it's hard to figure out what tools to use, find documentation, or guess where the change to be made, it's going to be too challenging for a newcomer.

				            Speaker:  Not all contributions involve setting up a development environment, but for those that do, this can be a major hurdle.  This picture here is of a group of students and mentors at Purdue University last fall.  We asked one of the students to write about the obstacles she faced when trying to make the contribution.  This is what she wrote.

				        <h3>Issue #4:  Anxiety and Self-Doubt</h3> 
				        <aside class="notes">
				            Speaker:  In addition to all of the technical obstacles we've outline above, there are a number of psychological barriers newcomers face when getting started in free and open source software.  I can't tell you how many times I've heard a student say "I don't want to be a burden" or "But I'm just a beginner" or "I don't know how to code".  These aren't unreasonable things to be thinking.  There *is* a stereotype of open source as all about programming - students aren't getting that from nowhere.  People who are just beginning *do* have certain limitations.  
				            
				            It's important both to validate these feelings as reasonable and to help students move past them.

				            Speaker: We do a few things to help address these things -- although we could definitely do more.  For instance, on our career panels, we ask people to talk about the obstacles they faced when they were getting started, and the insecurities they felt and currently feel.  We're adding a section on impostor syndrome as part of our workshop curriculum.  We're also going to start up a mentorship program which emphasizes not just the mentor-mentee relationship but cohorts where newcomers are encouraged to support and encourage each other.

				                When improving your development environment setup, get newcomers to test it out.

				            Speaker:  It turns out newcomers have this kind of superpower.  They can make things easier for other newcomers by helping you find and fix problems.  Engaging newcomers in this work is a vital part of growing your community and improving your project.  This is something that most newcomers won't believe, but it's very, very true.  So my strongest advice to you is - find some newcomers and engage with them and make sure they know how valuable they are.
				            
				            But maybe you don't have any newcomers to ask for help right now.  Maybe what you have right now is you.  You're in luck, though, because guess what?  You were a newcomer once, too.

				              Speaker:  Which brings us, finally, to this sessions's activity.  We're going to channel our inner newcomers in an attempt to understand the obstacles people face when they try to contribute to open source projects, and then we're going to brainstorm ways to help newcomers over, under, around and through those obstacles.
				              I want you to start by taking out one or two of the handouts I'm passing around.  Then, turn to the person next to you.  They're going to be your partner -- once you've finished with each step, explain your answers to each other.  Your partner can keep you honest so you don't just skip something.
