				<p>"Although the Open Source Initiative suggests "the promise of open source is better quality, higher reliability, more flexibility," this promise is not always realized. Although we do not often advertise the fact, any user of an early-stage free software project can explain that free software is not always as convenient, in purely practical terms, as its proprietary competitors. Free software is sometimes low quality. It is sometimes unreliable. It is sometimes inflexible."</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							Benjamin Mako Hill wrote a post back in 2010 where he points out the flaws in the OSI’s definition:
							<br />
							It’s vitally important not to equate the success of free and open source software with success in the market.
							<br />
							We can’t ignore money, but we also shouldn’t be tied to a single model of sustainability or a single standard for success.

							A conversation that’s focused on profit is a conversation that’s way too narrow.

						This lack of diversity is unfair to those excluded and hypocritical for a community that prides itself on being free and open.<br />

					<h3>Fear of Corporations</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						I’ve already highlighted a number of open source projects supported by for-profit companies.<br />
						These efforts are not without their critics, and these critics are not without their reasons.<br />
						Fear that goals of companies and community will not align.  That when there's conflict, companies will pursue their bottom lines.
						And perhaps they will.  But “for profit companies” are not a monolith, any more than “open source software” is. <br />
						Different ways that companies can interact with projects and if we can identify the beneficial ways than we can support them while discouraging others.

					<aside class="notes">
						Here's a quick case study: 2004 "open source" SugarCRM released.  Quickly popular, lots of downloads, tens of mil in VC investment.<br/>
						By 2011 company went "freemium", releasing paid proprietary versions.  By 2014, they announced they were no longer supporting open source version.<br />
						So do we conclude companies are bad for open source?  Company SuiteCRM forked the OS version and adopted a pay for hosting model.  They seem to do a good job from this distant vantage point.<br />
						Perhaps instead the lesson to learn is that “freemium” open source business models leave projects more vulnerable than “hosting” open source business models.

					<h3>Fear of Communism</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						In 2005, Bill Gates famously called FOSS activists "new modern-day sort of communists"<br />
						By textbook definition, this is ludicrous, but in American culture "communism" is a smear used to discourage forms of collective action.<br />
						Since many FOSS people lean libertarian, this makes it extra difficult to talk about.<br />
						But let's leap right in and talk about the role of state intervention.<br />
						In “The Entrepreneurial State”, Mariana Mazzucato challenges idea that business responsible for tech development.<br />
						Despite protests that gov't should "step back and let business innovate" the state has stepped forward to develop our most important technologies.

				<h1>Next Steps</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					Getting to the end of the talk, so let's focus on specific steps.<br />
					To start off, we need to talk more openly and empathetically about money, in individual conversations and in our public discussions at conferences, in workplaces and online.<br />
					Why is it so important to talk about money?  Because everyone views money differently.  It's an age-old and familiar abstraction - but a super leaky one.

						Silence about money reinforces inequality.  It's well documented that men get paid more than women and whites more than nearly every other racial and ethnic group.<br />
						Transparency won't fix everything, but it's a good step.<br />
						As long as talking about money is stigmatized, people will tend to discuss money only with close friends, who will tend to be in their demographic group, who will tend to be paid the same as them.<br />

					Luckily for us, we're not alone.  Open source is all about working openly and collaboratively.  Let’s apply our process and our values to this vital issue.
