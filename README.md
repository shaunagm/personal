This is a repository for miscellaneous personal (but public) files.

It includes the directories:

"minor projects": mostly coding exercises, nothing big or interesting enough to deserve its own repository

"miscellaneous_files": various teaching materials, stories, apps-themes-other-code, primarily referenced from shauangm.net
(Note to self: be careful when moving these files, as doing so will likely break inbound links.)

"project euler": files from solving project euler problems

"data analysis": what it says on the tin

"notes": notes on books, articles, etc in Markdown
